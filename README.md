**Overview**

This repository focuses on Spam Detection and News Article Classification, leveraging machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The project aims to identify spam messages and classify news articles into relevant categories using various machine learning and deep learning models.

**Key objectives include:**

- Developing accurate models for spam detection in text data (e.g., email, SMS).
- Classifying news articles into predefined categories such as sports, politics, technology, etc.

**Key Features**

**Spam Detection:**

- Utilizes supervised machine learning algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest).
- Preprocessing steps include tokenization, stopword removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.

**News Article Classification:**

- Implements multi-class classification models for assigning topics to articles.
- Models include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks.

**Text Preprocessing:**

- Text cleaning, stemming/lemmatization, and vectorization (TF-IDF, Count Vectorizer, Word2Vec).

**Evaluation Metrics:**

- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Confusion Matrix.
